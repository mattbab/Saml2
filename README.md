This is a fork of [Sustainsys/Saml2](https://github.com/Sustainsys/Saml2) to add support for passing the Subject in the AuthnRequest as well as other adaptations based on our requirements. We've removed support for all frameworks besides AspNetCore to reduce the support footprint. This fork probably isn't what you want to use.
